# Dante AV Infrastructure Deployment — From Analog to IP  

---

## Project Story  

I was entrusted with one of the largest technical upgrades our workplace had taken on in years. It wasn’t just about moving equipment around, it meant managing a major investment, earning the confidence of leadership, and making sure the outcome was worth every dollar. In the end, we finished the project about nine percent under budget, which showed that the resources were handled carefully and wisely.  

The system we had before was completely analog. There was no digital routing, no remote access, and no way to scale for FOH, livestream, or playback. I led the transition into a Dante-based IP setup that gave us digital routing, centralized control, and the flexibility to keep growing in the future.

## My Role  

I carried the responsibility of planning, budgeting, and coordinating the entire project. I worked closely with our IT and audio volunteers who brought their expertise in networking and cabling, but my role was to keep everything moving forward and make sure all the pieces came together.  

That meant presenting the vision and getting approval, managing the full purchasing and vendor process, designing the Dante and AES50 routing, running cable across the building, and setting up remote support so the system could be managed securely from anywhere. I also wrote documentation so our team could understand how the system worked and be confident supporting it long term.

## Why Dante  

Dante gave us what we needed most: flexibility. We could finally separate FOH, livestream, and in-ear mixes. We could send audio and stems between rooms without any signal loss. We could adjust routing in real time with Dante Controller. And it gave us the option to add lighting and MIDI over IP later on without having to redo the entire system.

## What We Built  

At the center of the system is a Midas M32 console running as the master clock. For in-ear monitoring we use a Behringer X32 Rack connected through AES50, along with two DL16 stage boxes daisy chained together. On the computer side, Mac Minis run livestream audio, Ableton multitracks, ProPresenter for slides and media, and LightKey for lighting. Everything is tied together through a managed Dante VLAN with static IPs, and the FOH and livestream computers are accessible remotely through MFA-protected connections.

## Week to Week  

The work didn’t stop once the project was finished. Each week I stay involved by adjusting Dante routing for FOH and livestream, updating Ableton sessions for multitrack outputs, troubleshooting sync and routing issues, and helping volunteers rotate through the different AV and livestream stations.

## Documentation  

The documentation that came out of this project includes the full install and routing setup, Ableton channel maps, an overview of Dante signal flow, remote recovery notes, and a budget summary. Sensitive details like vendor accounts and invoices were kept private, but the system documentation is there so anyone on the team can step in and understand how it works.

## Looking Back  

This project was about more than installing new gear. It was about trust, leadership, and collaboration. What we built together is reliable, scalable, and ready for the future — and I’m proud of how the team came together to make it happen.
