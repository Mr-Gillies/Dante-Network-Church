# Full S# Full System Handbook

This guide outlines the key steps for operating our AV network each week. It’s designed to support team members — especially rotating volunteers — and keep our systems consistent, stable, and recoverable.

## What’s Included

- **Power Sequencing**  
  Proper order for turning on/off equipment to avoid resets or signal loss.

- **Dante Controller Routing**  
  Overview of weekly Dante input/output checks and any updates for that Sunday’s setup.

- **Ableton Audio Output Configuration**  
  Channel routing and how to verify outputs for click, cues, and stems.

- **MIDI Setup & Sync**  
  How MIDI signals are used to trigger slides and lighting cues, and how they stay in sync with Ableton Live.

- **Troubleshooting & Escalation**  
  What to check if something breaks, in what order, and when to escalate to someone on the IT or Audio team.

---

This handbook exists so team members don’t have to guess — it reflects the actual flow we’ve built, tested, and use every week.
