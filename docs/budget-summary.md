## Budget Transparency & Security Note

For security and privacy reasons, this file does **not** include a full line-by-line expense report or vendor list. All purchasing records — including invoices, product links, serial numbers, and licensing details — were maintained privately and submitted internally for accountability.

This summary is meant to provide a high-level overview of spending categories and scope. The full procurement sheet is retained offline.

This project was completed under budget while meeting all technical and operational goals. We reused equipment where possible and made purchasing decisions with long-term scalability and team workflows in mind.
