# Legacy Planning & Brainstorming

This folder holds some of the original sketches and ideas from early 2022, when we first started thinking about moving from our old analog setup to a full Dante-based network system.

At the time, nothing was locked in yet — these were just rough concepts that helped shape the final direction. Some of the ideas changed along the way, but these drawings helped us visualize how we could rewire the building, relocate stations, and connect everything through Dante, AES50, SDI, and MIDI.

## Included:

- **Brainstorm Drawings for the Plan (Plans ended up changing)**  
  First pass at how everything could be routed — not the final version, but helpful for early layout thinking.

- **My Original Sketch**  
  Cleaned-up version that shows more accurate cable runs and where different rooms would be placed.

These were both drawn and planned by Ryan Gillies before full deployment started. Keeping them here as part of the process and history of the project.
